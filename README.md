#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/V83LPI-6nP4
#### Description:
Chat GPT Clone is a Conversational AI project that utilizes GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models to create an interactive chatbot system. This project aims to provide users with a realistic and engaging conversation experience by leveraging the power of GPT models.

The purpose of this project is to showcase the capabilities of GPT models in natural language processing and generation. By integrating with the OpenAI GPT3.5 Turbo API, the chatbot is able to understand user input and generate relevant and coherent responses. It demonstrates the potential of GPT models in various applications such as virtual assistants, customer support, and interactive conversational systems.

The project consists of key file that contribute to its functionality:

1. 'project.py': This is the main Python script that serves as the entry point for the chatbot program. It handles user input, communication with the GPT API, and displays the chatbot's responses.

During the development process, certain design choices were made to enhance the user experience and ensure the smooth functioning of the chatbot:

1. Input and Output Validation: To ensure the chatbot handles user input appropriately, input validation techniques such as try/except blocks and regular expressions are implemented. This helps in preventing errors and maintaining the integrity of the conversation.

2. Integration with Class Loader: The integration of the Class Loader provides a visually appealing loading animation while the chatbot processes longer responses. This engages the user and provides feedback on the ongoing conversation.

3. Conversation History: The project includes the functionality to record the conversation history in a CSV file. This allows users to review past interactions and maintain a record of their conversations with the chatbot.

By providing a user manual and system commands, the project offers clear instructions for users to navigate and interact with the chatbot effectively. It also enables users to view the conversation history and explore various functions.

In conclusion, the Chat GPT Clone project demonstrates the potential of GPT models in building conversational AI systems. Through the integration of GPT3.5 Turbo API and thoughtful design choices, it provides an engaging and interactive chatbot experience. The project offers a glimpse into the exciting world of conversational AI and its possibilities for various applications in natural language processing and human-like interactions.
